// the shorter the feedback the smaller is the effective gamma, the longer takes it to reach the steady state!!!! for longer tau, a known length to steady state can be reduced 
// ATTENTION one of the pn must be inequal zero 
// there is always a mistake due to the finite time step size !!! and the cutoff in bins!!! 
// feedback zero is possible ... phase is still important, for 0,2pi, ... the decay vanishes!!!
// this means, comparison between no feedback at feedback is not between tau=0 and finite tau
// pi=3.14159265359
// stabilization at 2pi/tau=g_cav
// = ATTENTION!!! = search for possible initial-state impact on steady state to prove non-Markovianity!!!
// = ATTENTION!!! = also the quest for second-rung features is still on!!!
// = ATTENTION!!! = also, maybe using the tls as storage, is it possible to swap excitation into it, until it is fully loaded?
// = ATTENTION!!! = also, the imaginary feedback thing is still on, not used
